# COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. **The College of Charleston requires that masks be worn while indoors and you must wear a mask at all times while in class.** Although vaccinations are currently not required, _I ask you to be respectful of the health and safety of others_. If you have not received the **COVID-19 vaccine, which is safe, free, and effective, please consider doing so immediately**. Information about the vaccine is available from the [SCDHEC website](https://scdhec.gov/covid19/covid-19-vaccine) and information about where and when to obtain a vaccine is also available on the SCDHEC website [vaccine locator page](https://vaxlocator.dhec.sc.gov/).    

# Course Description

Social-ecological systems are ecological systems that are linked to and affected by one or more social systems. Management and governance of such systems include a wide range of stakeholders and institutions. In this course we will examine various approaches to governing and managing these systems to make them more resilient.  

\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent This course is cross-listed with graduate students in both the M.S. Environmental and Sustainability (MES) program. Note, if you take this course as an undergraduate student, you will not be able to take it as a graduate student. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent This course will be _lecture_ and _discussion_ based. Being able to adequately participate requires you to come to class prepared by having done the assigned readings prior to class. In addition, you should be prepared to participate in class by asking questions and making informed comments that add to the class discussion. **I may call on you to answer a question or discuss your case study**. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent Laptops are allowed, but discouraged. Phones should be put away during class.  _I encourage you to take notes by hand, with pen and paper_. [You learn better that way](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/learning/should-teachers-and-professors-ban-student-use-of-laptops-in-class.html). I recommend taking notes using the [Cornell Method](http://www.usu.edu/arc/idea_sheets/pdf/note_taking_cornell.pdf).    

## Course Prerequisites

Must have junior or senior standing or attain approval from the instructor.

## Attendance Policy 

Attendance will be taken for each class session, and will be part of your course engagement grade. You are allowed to miss _two classes without penalty_.  **However, do not come to class if you feel ill. Additionally, if you have been exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19, do not come to class regardless of how you feel. In those cases, I am happy to meet with you on Zoom to discuss material you missed and wave the attendance requirement. Just let me know.** 

## Course Goals and Learning Objectives

After taking this course student will: 

* Develop an understanding of social-ecological systems. 

* Articulate the challenges involved with the management of common-pool resources and social-ecological systems governance.  

* Understand the role of institutions in managing the commons and in social-ecological systems governance. 

* Differentiate the role that institutions and policy play in models of social-ecological systems. 
   
* Be able to produce a recommendation to improve governance of a social-ecological system. 

\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent These objectives will be achieved through critically reading the course readings, by writing several reflection essays, a case study project that applies Ostrom's Social-Ecological Framework to a particular social-ecological system, and course engagement.

## Assignments 

Specific instructions for the following assignments are posted on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/d2l/home). All work must be turned in through the Assignment folder on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu), and is due at class time unless otherwise specified. 

\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent \textbf{Reflection papers}: You will write 8 short, about a page, reflection papers that summarize and integrate the readings. Prompts will be given for each paper in [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). **When assigned, reflection papers are due on Mondays at class time.**  

\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent \textbf{Case study}: You will develop a case study that applies Ostrom's SES Framework to a specific social-ecological system. Sections of the case study will be completed and turned in throughout the semester. The final case study should be about 10 to 15 pages. You will also give a short presentation, about 15 minutes, of your case study. 

\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent \textbf{Course engagement}: Course engagement involves coming to class prepared, having read, and ready with questions and comments.  

## Late Work Policy 

Late work is subject to a 48-hour grace period, and after that will be penalized 10% each day (24 hr period) it is late, up to 3 days. After 3 days the assignment will not be accepted. For example, if an assignment is due Wednesday at 2:00 PM, the grace period ends on Friday at 2:00 PM and it is late as of 2:01 PM and you lose 10%. After Saturday at 2:01 PM you lose another 10%, after Sunday at 2:01 PM another 10%, and no work will be accepted after Monday at 2:00 PM. _No late work will accepted 72 hrs after the assignment due date and time_.
