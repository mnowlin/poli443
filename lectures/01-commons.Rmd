**It follows that two options are available:** 

1) establish, monitor, and enforce private property rights 

2) directly regulate the use of the commons either by taxing or directly restricting (e.g., licensing) its use

history wrong - commons were often well-regulated by users; implications of views about over population; right about human nature?; is freedom to breed intorable?

# Ostrom's Critiques of Hardin 

**Two questions**: 

* How well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?

--

* Does the binary choice between government command-and-control regulation and private property–enabled markets reflect the full range of options?

how realistic are lab settings? one-shot games?
