# Analyzing Institutions 

**_Given that there is such a large variety of regularized social interactions in markets, hierarchies, families, legislatures, elections, and other situations, is it even possible to find a common terminology to study them?_**

--

**What are the building blocks of institutions?**

The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework 

---

class: title title-1 

# The IAD 

**Action arena**: occurs whenever individuals interact, exchange goods, or solve problems; **participants**, _rules and norms, and attributes of the physical world_ come together. 

--

**Action situation**: the rules and norms and the attributes of the physical world

--

**Interactions** 

--

**Evaluative criteria**: judging the performance of a system

**Digging deeper into some of the terms (McGinnis 2011)**

--

.small[**Institutions**: are human-constructed constraints or opportunities within which individual choices take place and which shape the consequences of their choices.]

--

.small[**Analysis**: involves decomposition of institutional contexts into their component parts as a prelude to understanding how these parts affect each other and how institutions shape outcomes.]

--

.small[**Development**: is interpreted broadly as referring to the processes of dynamic changes of institutions as well as changes in their effects over time.]

# The IAD 

**Digging deeper into some of the terms (McGinnis 2011)**

**Governance**: is the process by which the repertoire of rules, norms, and strategies that guide behavior within a given realm of policy interactions are formed, applied, interpreted, and reformed. 

--

* _Self-governance_: The capacity of communities to organize themselves so they can actively participate in all (or at least the most important) decision processes relating to their own governance.

**Governance**: is the process by which the repertoire of rules, norms, and strategies that guide behavior within a given realm of policy interactions are formed, applied, interpreted, and reformed. 

* _Monocentric governance_: Ideal type conceptualization of unitary sovereignty ... No real-world governance system is fully monocentric, yet some governance systems concentrate a great deal of power in the hands of a small number of authorities at the national level.
