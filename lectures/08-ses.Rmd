# Framework 

_A framework provides the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms that may be used to construct the kinds of causal explanations expected of a theory. Frameworks organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry._ 

--

_Frameworks identify the elements and general relationships among these elements that one needs to consider for institutional analysis and they organize diagnostic and prescriptive inquiry. They provide a general set of variables that can be used to analyze all types of institutional arrangements._

# Framework 1.0 

**A SES framework must address three issues:** 

--

1) cooperation and potential for collective action must be maintained within the social system, 

--

2) ecological systems are dynamic, as are the rules of the games that agents play amongst themselves, and 

--

3) ecological systems can occupy multiple stable states and move rapidly between them.

# Beyond Panaceas: Framework 2.0

_Instead, we need to recognize and understand the complexity to develop diagnostic methods to identify combinations of variables that affect the incentives and actions of actors under diverse governance systems_. 

--

_To do this we need to examine the nested attributes of a resource system and the resource units generated by that system that jointly affect the incentives of users within a set of rules crafted by local, distal, or nested governance systems to affect interactions and outcomes over time_

# Framework 3.0 

_All humanly used resources are embedded in complex, social-ecological systems (SESs)._ 

--

_SESs are composed of multiple subsystems and internal variables within these subsystems at multiple levels analogous to organisms composed of organs, organs of tissues, tissues of cells, cells of proteins, etc._
