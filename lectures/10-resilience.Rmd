# Complex Adaptive Systems 

--

**Dynamical systems with many components that interact in ways that result in _emergent_ behaviors that are often unpredictable using current methods and technologies** 

--

_Consists of heterogeneous collections of individual agents that interact locally, and evolve in their genetics, behaviors, or spatial distributions based on the outcome of those interactions_ 

--

**Creates uncertainty where static equilibrium states are difficult to predict**

---

class: title title-1 

# Complex Adaptive Systems 

**Involve**: 
* Systems of nested systems (Nested hierarchies) 
* Multiplicity of cross-scale interactions
* Feedback loops between different hierarchical levels 



---

class: title title-1 

# Complex Adaptive Systems

**Emergence** 
* _The whole is better than the sum of the parts_ 

--
* The aggregate exhibits properties not attained by summation 

--
* Non-linear 

--
* Hierarchy: aggregates at one level become _building blocks_ for emergent properties at a higher level 
 * e.g., wetness is an emergent property of the aggregation of $H_2O$ molecules 
---

class: title title-1 

# Complex Adaptive Systems

**Behaviors of complex adaptive systems** 
* Emergence 

--
* Self-organization in patterns 

--
* Chaotic: small changes produce large changes 

--
* Fat-tailed: rare events more often than expected under a normal distribution 

--
* Adaptive interaction: interacting agents modify their strategies in diverse ways as experience accumulates 

---

class: title title-1 

# Complex Adaptive Systems

**Co-evolution** 

_we conceive co-evolution as dynamic interactions between two or more interdependent systems, which account mutually for each other's development_ 

--

**Across three hierarchical (semi-autonomous) levels** 
* natural resources
* institutions and social organizations
* individual behavior  

---

class: title title-1

# Resilience 

--

**The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and re-organize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedbacks**  

.tiny[-Folke, Carl. 2006. "Resilience: The Emergence of a Perspective for Social–Ecological Systems Analyses." _Global Environmental Change_ 16(3): 253–67.
]

--

The ability of a system to remain within one _regime_ 

--

**Regime**: self-reinforcing states of attraction; "steady state", "equilibrium" 
* Feedback 

---

class: title title-1

# Resilience 

**Resilience reflects the degree to which a complex adaptive system is capable of self-organization (versus lack of organization or organization forced by external factors) and the degree to which the system can build and sustain the capacity for learning and adaptation** 

.tiny[-Norberg, Jon, James Wilson, Brian Walker, and Elinor Ostrom. 2008. “Diversity and Resilience of Social-Ecological Systems.” In Complexity Theory for a Sustainable Future, eds. Jon Norberg and Graeme S. Cumming. New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 46–79.

**Adaptive capacity**: _the capacity of the system to alter the relative abundance of its components without significant changes in critical system functions_

class: title title-1

# Diversity 

--

_There is a growing recognition that diversity is a key requirement for long-term (sustainable) functioning of systems -- biological and social_ 

--

**Diversity and redundancy** 

--

Assume a group of units with 10 attributes 
* Redundancy: all units have the same values for each attribute 
* Diversity: differences in values in one or another attribute 

---

class: title title-1

# Ecosystem Management 

**Ecological systems (ecosystems)**: geographic areas where living entities (plants, animals, and other organisms) and nonliving entities (including water, air, and soil) interact in mutually interdependent ways

---

class: title title-1

# Ecosystem Management 

**Ecosystem management**: seeks to preserve, sustain, and secure whole ecosystems and the qualities of ecosystems that are deemed valuable 

* Trade-off competing social, cultural, and environmental values
* _Ecosystem services_
  * benefits ecosystems provide to humans 
  * **generated by structures or processes sustained by one or several species** 

---

class: title title-1

#  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

**Biodiversity**: _count the number of species in a certain place, also known as "species richness."_ 

--

The term captures two notions: 
* A world teeming with wildlife
* The political problem of stopping extinctions

--

**Does every species matter?**

class: title title-1

#  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

**Ecosystem function** 

--

* Focus on what functions the species perform within an ecosystem as opposed to the overall number of species 

--

* Shifting focus from diversity of species to diversity of traits in a species community

--

**Do we know enough about any specific species and their role within an ecosystem?** 

---

class: title title-1

#  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

**Functional groups**: Species that perform similar ecosystem functions or have similar structures

--

**Attributes of species** 
* Morphology: size, biomass, structure 
* Physiology: movement, excretion, spawning 

--

**Functional diversity**: Differences in morphological and physiological traits, response traits, and resource use traits

---

class: title title-1

#  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

**Response diversity** 
* _Response traits_: The traits of species that affect their abilities to perform under different environmental conditions 
* _Response diversity is the degree of variation in response traits formed within a functional group of species_  

--

**It has been shown that response diversity is directly correlated to the capacity of a system to respond to changing conditions without a reduction in system functioning**

---

class: title title-1

# Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

_In order to preserve the capacity of a community to change in response to changing conditions, **the crucial focus for conservation efforts should be on sustaining the sources of diversity**, rather than a particular set of species, which ensure that there is a continuous supply of species that can compete under current environmental conditions_ 

.tiny[-Norberg, Jon, James Wilson, Brian Walker, and Elinor Ostrom. 2008. “Diversity and Resilience of Social-Ecological Systems.” In Complexity Theory for a Sustainable Future, eds. Jon Norberg and Graeme S. Cumming. New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 46–79.

# Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

**Three scales of ecosystem diversity** 

--

* _Landscape_: diversity of communities within the landscape 

--

* _Species_: diversity of species within a community 

--

* _Genetic_: diversity of genes within a population of a species 

---

class: title title-1

# Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

**Sources of diversity** 

**Landscape** 

_Consists of the variability in the land- or seascape, providing a multitude of different conditions for which different sets of attributes are most suited_ 

--

**In a heterogeneous and changing landscape, dispersal, mobility, and ways of enduring unfavorable situations are an essential source of diversity in addition to complementarity between species**

--

* Regulate spatial extent over which rules are applied 
  * Community involvement 

---

class: title title-1

# Institutional Diversity and Governance 

**Sources of institutional diversity**

* _Information transfer_: learning from other locations; particularly useful among local areas with similar conditions 

--

* _Context transfer_: use a rule in a different context (e.g., v-notch in lobster tail for conservation)

---

class: title title-1

# Institutional Diversity and Governance 

**Managing for diversity** 

--
* _Spatiotemporal heterogeneity_ 
  * Introduce moderate disturbances to prevent diversity loss
  * Changing preferences (e.g., elections)
  * Ability for local decision-making 
  
--

* _Enable local coexistence_ 
  * Ecosystem: maintain diversity at the base level 
  * Institutions: diversity of rules used. _How_ rules versus _how much_ 

---

class: title title-1

# Institutional Diversity and Governance 

**Managing for diversity** 

_Some species or rules are more critical for the performance of the system than others_ 

--

* Keystone species 

--

* Boundary rules 
  * Define boundaries 
  * Use can use the resource 

---

class: title title-1

# Institutional Diversity and Governance 

**Managing for diversity** 

_Balance costs_ 

There are costs associated with sustaining diversity 
* Ecosystems: suboptimal species; decrease current efficiency but may increase long-term efficiency if conditions change 

--
* Institutions: 
  * Cognitive costs 
  * Collective costs of changing rules
