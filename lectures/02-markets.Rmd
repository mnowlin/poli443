# Demand and Supply 

<br>

**Supply curve**: represents how much the sellers (collectively) are willing to sell or produce at a given price
* Upward sloping 
* _At higher prices output expands_

**Maximizing net benefits** 
* Difference is greatest between total cost and total benefit 
* Marginal cost = marginal benefit

# Efficiency

**Three conditions**: 

--

1. **Competitive**: price takers 

--

2. **Information**: complete

3. **Complete**: benefits and costs captured by price
