# What are institutional statements? 

---

class: title title-1

# Institutional Statements 
.footnote[.tiny[Ostrom 2005, 137-138]]

A broad term that encompasses the types of statements: 
* Rules 
* Norms
* Shared strategies 

--

_These statements describe opportunities and constraints that create expectations about other actors' behavior_

# Institutional Statements 
.footnote[.tiny[Ostrom 2005, 137-138]]

_Encompasses a broad set of **shared** linguistic constraints and opportunities that prescribe, permit, or advise actions or outcomes for participants in an action situation_ 

--

Rules-in-use and attributes of the community (norms and shared strategies)

--

**Rules can be classified (or grouped together) into particular types**

# Why?

* to work further toward solving _babbling equilibrium_ problems for scholars doing institutional analysis 

--

* to understand how action situations are constructed so that reasonable reforms can be considered 

--

* to move beyond slogan words to describe institutions

# Why?

* to cope with the immense diversity of rules by clustering them generic rules

* to look at rules as information-transformation mechanisms 

--

* to study the underlying universality of rules

# Grammar of Institutions 

**Institutional grammar contains a general syntax (_ADICO_)** 

* **ATTRIBUTES (A)** 

* **DEONTIC (D)** 

* **AIM (I)** 

* **CONDITIONS (C)** 

* **OR ELSE (O)** 

---

class: title title-1

# Grammar of Institutions 

**ATTRIBUTES (A)** 

_Defines the participants to whom the statement applies_ 


--

**Example**: 

_In order for a person to obtain a hunting license in the state of Arizona (s)he must be 10 years of age or older, a resident of the state of Arizona and pay a fee or else no license will be issued_

--

**a person who wants to obtain a hunting license in the state of Arizona** 

---

class: title title-1

# Grammar of Institutions 

**ATTRIBUTES (A)** 

_Defines the participants to whom the statement applies_ 

**Example**: 

_If you use the microwave, you must clean up your own mess!_ 

--

**a person that uses the microwave; _if you use the microwave_** 

---

class: title title-1

# Grammar of Institutions 

**DEONTIC (D)**

_Draws on deontic logic to distinguish prescriptive from non-prescriptive statements_ 

* Permitted: Can, may

* Obliged: Must, should

* Forbidden: Must not, should not  

???
deontic logic:  the field of philosophical logic that is concerned with obligation, permission, and related concepts

---

class: title title-1

# Grammar of Institutions 

**DEONTIC (D)**

_Draws on deontic logic to distinguish prescriptive from non-prescriptive statements_ 

**Example**: 

_All lobster fishers in Maine **must not** put their traps in the fishing territory of neighboring harbor, or else their traps may be cut loose.__

---

class: title title-1

# Grammar of Institutions 

**AIM (I)**

_The specific description of a working part in an action situation to which an institutional statement refers_

* Action 

--

**Example**: 

_The person who places a phone call is the one who **calls back** when the call gets disconnected_

---

class: title title-1

# Grammar of Institutions 

**CONDITIONS (C)**

_Indicate the set of variables that define when and where an institutional statement applies_ 

--

**Example**: 

_The person who places a phone call is the one who calls back **when the call gets disconnected**_

---

class: title title-1

# Grammar of Institutions 

**OR ELSE (O)**

_The consequence that an institutional statement assigns to detected noncompliance with the other components of the statement_ 

--

**Example**: 

_All lobster fishers in Maine must not put their traps in the fishing territory of neighboring harbor, **or else their traps may be cut loose**_

---

class: title title-1

# Rules, Norms, Shared Strategies 

**What are the differences between rules, norms, and shared strategies?** 

--

**Rules**: contain all five elements: ADICO 

--

**Norms**: contain ADIC 

--

**Shared strategies**: contain AIC 

---

# Examples 

**You must turn in your reflection papers when they are do or else you won't pass the class** 

--

**You should raise your hand when you want to ask a question in class** 

--

**Raise your hand when you want to ask a question in class**

--

**You must do the readings**

_The third and fourth [last] examples do not specify specific CONDITIONS; therefore, we assume that the rules apply for Maine fishers and microwave users under all circumstances. Note that conditions often apply to physical realityâ€”i.e., when a call is disconnected. However, conditions are often specified by scope rules that restrict choices to very specific conditions_

**How to use the IAD framework (McGinnis 2013)** 

* Step 4: Systematically examine categories of the framework 
  * Actors in positions 
  * Rules-in-use 
  * Attributes of communities 
  * Types of goods 
  * Evaluative criteria 
  * Feedback loops

# The IAD 

**How to use the IAD framework (McGinnis 2013)** 

* Step 5: Follow the information flow 

--

* Step 6: Locate adjacent (or supplemental) action situations 

--

* Step 7: Select critical adjacent actions situations 

--

* Step 8: Compare and contrast the ways these linked and nested action situations are interrelated

# The IAD 

**How to use the IAD framework (McGinnis 2013)** 

* Step 9: Identify the most critical steps for more detailed analysis

--

* Step 10: Draw upon principles of research design or evaluative research to select cases for further analysis by whatever methods are best suited to that purpose
