# What are systems?

class: title title-1 

# Systems 

**_Systems_ are composed of component parts which interact with each other.** 

--

* _State variables_: the component parts 

--
* _Feedback_: system outputs $\rightarrow$ inputs

--

* Person in a shower 
* Other examples?

# Systems 

**Feedback**

--

.pull-left[
* _Feedback loop_: cycling of signals 
  * $\Delta$ _A_ $\rightarrow$ $\Delta$ _B_ $\rightarrow$ $\Delta$ _A_
* _Positive feedback_: change in the same direction 
* _Negative feedback_: change in the opposite direction

# Systems 

**Resilience** 

--

_the magnitude of the largest disturbance the system can absorb without transforming into a new state._ 

--

* Systems can have multiple types of states  
  * e.g., _a lake can be either clear or green and murkey, a rangeland can have a mix of healthy tall grass and with a few trees and shrubs, or it can be covered with noxious weeds_ 

???
state: possible configuration 

steady state: equilibrium point

# Systems 

**Resilience** 

_the magnitude of the largest disturbance the system can absorb without transforming into a new state._ 

* Systems can have multiple types of states 

* Resilient systems stay in the same state following disturbances  

* As systems become less resilient, they are less able to withstand even small disturbances  

---

class: title title-1 

# Systems 

**Tipping points** 

--

The point at which a system moves from one state to another
* Feedback dynamics change 
* A threshold is crossed 

--

Typically don't know until after it has happened 

--

Near a tipping point the system may be _balanced_ 
* rate of rebalance after a small disturbance slows

???
ratio is near 50/50

--

**Sustainability**  
* Is the goal 
* _Keep a resource from depleting_ 
* _Avoidance of inequality_ 

---

class: title title-1 

# Systems 

**Resilience, robustness, and sustainability**

**Robustness** 
* _Focuses on feedback systems with clearly defined boundaries_ 
* _used to address questions about how to control a system to reach a target_ 

---

class: title title-1 

# Systems 

**Resilience** 
* _Provides a framework to think about how multiple systems, each operating at their characteristic temporal and spatial scales, interact across scale_

# Coupled Infrastructure Systems 

**Infrastructure** 

--

> _infrastructure_ is a collection of materials (e.g., machines) and information (e.g., knowledge about how to use machines) that can produce a stream of materials (food, cars, houses) and information (music, movies) that society values.

--

_requires investment to produce and maintain and infrastructure typically has little value in its own right_

class: title title-1 

# Types of Infrastructure 

--

**Hard (gray) infrastructure** 
* _human-made infrastructure such as roads, irrigation systems, and nuclear power stations_ 
* Allows for the production and distribution of people, goods, and services

--

**Soft infrastructure** 
* _human-made “instruction” for using other types of infrastructure_ 
* e.g., software, institutions 

---

class: title title-1 

# Types of Infrastructure 

**Natural (green) infrastructure** 
* _hard infrastructure that is not man-made but still is critical for society_
* e.g., living shorelines 

--

**Human infrastructure** 
* _Knowledge is itself infrastructure because it requires investment and can produce valued outputs (when combined with other types of infrastructure)_ 

---

class: title title-1 

# Types of Infrastructure 

**Social infrastructure** 
* _Social infrastructure refers to the relationships we have with others_ 

--

**_To produce valuable outputs, multiple types of infrastructure must be combined_** 

---

class: title title-1 

# Collective Action and Infrastructure

**What are some collective action issues associated with infrastructure?** 

--

* Who is going to pay for it? 
  * _Federal government pays the majority of the costs for highways, so cities want more highways_ 

--

* Who gets access to its use?

# Complex Systems 

**_Complex Systems_ are composed of _multiple_ component parts which interact with each other _in multiple ways_.** 

--

_complex behaviour that emerges as a result of interactions among system components (or agents) and among system components (or agents) and the environment_*

# Complex Systems

**Emergence** 
* _The whole is better than the sum of the parts_ 

--
* The aggregate exhibits properties not attained by summation 

--
* Non-linear 

--
* Hierarchy: aggregates at one level become _building blocks_ for emergent properties at a higher level 
 * e.g., wetness is an emergent property of the aggregation of $H_2O$ molecules 
---

class: title title-1 

# Complex Systems

**Behaviors of complex systems** 
* Emergence 

--
* Self-organization in patterns 

--
* Chaotic: small changes produce large changes 

--
* Fat-tailed: rare events more often than expected under a normal distribution 

--
* Adaptive interaction: interacting agents modify their strategies in diverse ways as experience accumulates 

---

class: title title-1 

# Complex Adaptive Systems

**Composed of elements (_agents_), that learn or adapt in response to interactions with other agents** 

* Nested hierarchies 
* Multiplicity of cross-scale interactions
* Feedback loops between different hierarchical levels 

**Creates uncertainty where static equilibrium states are different to predict** 

---

class: title title-1 

# Complex Adaptive Systems

**Co-evolution** 

_we conceive co-evolution as dynamic interactions between two or more interdependent systems, which account mutually for each other's development_ 

--

**Across three hierarchical (semi-autonomous) levels** 
* natural resources
* institutions and social organizations
* individual behavior
