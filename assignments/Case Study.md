# Case Study 

For your case study you will select a social-ecological system and apply one (or both) of the Ostrom frameworks to your case. Your case should involve a common-pool resource or other environmental problem and be limited to a specific geographic area.  

Various drafts of sections of the case study will be due throughout the semester. 

**Part 1**: _Topic selection_: In about one or two paragraphs, describe your environmental or common-pool resource problem. Be sure and include its geographic boundaries.
