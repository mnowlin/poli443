# Research Design

For your research design you will select a social-ecological system and discuss the type of data you would collect and how you would collect it to apply one (or both) of the Ostrom frameworks. Your topic should involve a common-pool resource or other environmental problem and be limited to a specific geographic area. In addition, your data collection will focus on the governance aspects of your topic.  

Various drafts of sections of the research design will be due throughout the semester. 

**Part 1**: _Topic selection_: In about one or two paragraphs, describe your potential research topic. You should begin with a research question related to governance of a social-ecological system.
